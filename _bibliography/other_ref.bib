   abstract = "Flexible bevel-tipped needles are often used for needle insertion
               in minimally-invasive surgical techniques due to their ability to
               be steered in cluttered environments. Shapesensing enables
               physicians to determine the location of needles intra-operatively
               without requiring radiation of the patient, enabling accurate
               needle placement. In this paper, we validate a theoretical method
               for flexible needle shape-sensing that allows for complex
               curvatures, extending upon a previous sensor-based model. This
               model combines curvature measurements from fiber Bragg grating
               (FBG) sensors and the mechanics of an inextensible elastic rod to
               determine and predict the 3D needle shape during insertion. We
               evaluate the model's shape sensing capabilities in C- and S-shape
               insertions in single-layer isotropic tissue, and C-shape
               insertions in two-layer isotropic tissue. Experiments on a
               four-active area, FBG-sensorized needle were performed in varying
               tissue stiffnesses and insertion scenarios under stereo vision to
               provide the 3D ground truth needle shape. The results validate a
               viable 3D needle shape-sensing model accounting for complex
               curvatures in flexible needles with mean needle shape sensing
               root-mean-square errors of 0.160 $\pm$ 0.055 mm over 650 needle
