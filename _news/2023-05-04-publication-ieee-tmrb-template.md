Our paper entitled "Motorized template for MRI-guided focal cryoablation of prostate cancer" has been
published in IEEE Transactions on Medical Robotics and Bionics. The paper presents a new motorized template
device to assist a physician in placing ablation probes into the prostate under magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guidance
for focal ablation. The device, developed as part of our collaboration with Physical Sciences Inc., combined
a motorized tilting grid template with insertion depth sensing capabilities, enabling the physician to place the
cryo-needles precisely in the desired location. 

Our in-vivo study (swine) showed that the insertion depth feedback improved the 3D targeting accuracy compared to the
conventional insertion technique (7.4 mm vs. 11.2 mm, p=0.04). All three cases achieved full iceball coverage without
repositioning the cryo-needles. The results demonstrate the advantages of the motorized tilting mechanism, real-time
insertion depth feedback, and the feasibility of the proposed workflow for MRI-guided focal cryoablation of prostate
cancer.
