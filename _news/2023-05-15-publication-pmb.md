Our paper entitled "Data-driven adaptive needle insertion assist for transperineal prostate interventions" has been
published on Physics in Medicine and Biology. In this study, we investigated a robot-assisted collaborative needle
insertion method that only requires an actuated passive needle guide and a conventional needle, and demonstrated
that the proposed method significantly inproved the needle placement accuracy successfully.
