Our paper entitled "AI-based isotherm prediction for focal cryoablation of prostate cancer" has been published in Academic Radiology.
This is part of our effort to develop software/hardware infrastructures for the focal treatment of prostate cancer under MRI guidance.

In this study, we investigated a new AI model to predict the growth of cryoablation iceball to assist a physician in planning
the treatment. Specifically, we tested a convolutional neural network model based on 3D-Unet to predict the frozen isotherm
boundaries (iceball) resultant from a given cryo-needle placement. Intraprocedural magnetic resonance images acquired during
Thirty-eight cases of focal cryoablation of PCa were retrospectively used to train and validate the model.
