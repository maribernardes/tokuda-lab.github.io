Our collaborative team, consisting of scientists and clinician from Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech), 
Johns Hopkins University (JHU), and Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH), have received a new R01 grant entitled
"Improved arrhythmia ablation via MR-guided robotic catheterization and multimodal clinician feedback"
from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering.

With this 4-year, $2.5M grant, we will develop a multi-modal feedback-based navigation system and
MR- compatible robotic platform that enables precise, continuous, and permanent lesion creation
during MR-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment. 

The project will be led by Drs. Yue Chen, Ph.D. (Georgia Tech), Aravindan Kolandaivelu, M.D. (JHU), Ehud Schmidt, Ph.D. (JHU),
and Junichi Tokuda, Ph.D. (BWH). The BWH team will provide a software system that integrates image processing, visualization,
and robot control using the software infrastructure developed through a separate R01 project.
