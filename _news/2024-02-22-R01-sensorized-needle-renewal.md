Our collaborative team, consisting of the Tokuda Lab, [the Surgical navigation and Robotics Lab](https://snr.spl.harvard.edu) at Brigham and Women's Hospital (PI: Nobuhiko Hata, Ph.D.) and [the Advanced Medical Instrumentation and Robotics (AMIRo) Research Lab.](https://amiro.lcsr.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins University (PI: Iulian Iordachita, Ph.D.), has been awarded a 4-year, \$2.47M R01 grant from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for their medical robotics research project titled "Adaptive Percutaneous Prostate Interventions using Sensorized Needle." This is a renewal of a 3-year \$1.70M R01 grant previously awarded to the same team in 2019. Drs. Tokuda, Hata, and Iordachita will lead the project as PIs.
 
The project aims to develop a robotic system for minimally invasive prostate interventions, such as biopsy and focal treatment of prostate cancer. This system will utilize [a novel shape-sensing needle](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37216067/) and [needle-guiding manipulator](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37080237/) to accurately insert a needle into lesions identified by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The goal is to improve the accuracy of cancer diagnosis and the outcomes of focal treatment.
 
This project builds on a decade-long partnership between NCIGT, JHU, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), established by Clare Tempany, M.D., Director of NCIGT. This partnership leverages NCIGT's clinical and engineering expertise in image-guided therapy and JHU and WPIâ€™s expertise in robotics and sensing to advance the field of image-guided medical robotics. Since 2006, this partnership has secured seven new and renewal R01 grants with a total budget of more than $22.5M collectively from NCI and the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) leading to several successful clinical trials.
