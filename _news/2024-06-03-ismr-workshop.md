With our collaborators from Johns Hopkins University, Queen's University, and University of Maryland, we organized a workshop on "Leveraging SlicerROS2 for Simulation of Image-Guided Assisted Interventions in Gazebo (Ignition)" at International Symposium on Medical Robotics (Atlanta, GA). More than 30 participants, mostly students and faculties working in the medical robotics field, attend and learned about our [software frame work for image-guided robot-assisted interventions](https://rosmed.github.io).
