PI Tokuda organized an IGT Breakout Session at the 41st (Project Week)[https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW41_2024_MIT/], which took place from June 24 to 28 at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The IGT breakout session highlighted the development and clinical application of 3D Slicer related to image-guided therapy (IGT), including:

- Integration of 3D Slicer and Robot Operating System (ROS) (Junichi Tokuda, Anton Deguet)
- Simulated ultrasound imaging for simulation, training, and other applications (Xihan Ma, Worcester Polytechnic Institute)
- Clinical application of ultrasound-guided navigation of spine interventions (Tamas Ungi, Queen's University)
- NousNav, low-cost neurosurgical navigation system based on 3D Slicer (Sam Horvath, Kitware, Inc.)
