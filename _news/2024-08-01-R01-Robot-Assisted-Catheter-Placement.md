Our collaborative team, consisting of the Tokuda Lab, BWH Radiation Oncology, and [the Advanced Medical Instrumentation and Robotics (AMIRo) Research Lab.](https://amiro.lcsr.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins University (PI: Iulian Iordachita, Ph.D.), has been awarded a 4-year R01 grant from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) for their medical robotics research project titled "Robot-assisted catheter placement with novel shape-sensing stylet to facilitate adaptive image guided pelvic brachytherapy." Drs. Tokuda, Robert Cormack, Ph.D, and Iordachita will lead the project as PIs.
 
The project aims to develop a robotic system for HDR brachytherapy. This system will utilize [a novel shape-sensing needle](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37216067/) and [needle-guiding manipulator](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37080237/) to deploy brachytherapy catheters adaptively for better clinical outcomes.  


This project builds on a decade-long partnership between BWH Radiology, BWH Radiation Oncology, and JHU, established by Clare Tempany, M.D., Director of NCIGT. This partnership leverages NCIGT's clinical and engineering expertise in image-guided therapy and JHU expertise in robotics and sensing to advance the field of image-guided medical robotics. In 1998, the team successfully published the world's first MRI-guided brachytherapy of the prostate performed in a 0.5 Tesla open-configuration MRI system developed by BWH and GE Medical Systems (D'Amico AV et al, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1998 Oct 1;42(3):507-15.).
