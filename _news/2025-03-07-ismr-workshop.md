We will be organizing a workshop on "Open-Source Software for Intelligent Image-Guided Medical Robots" at the International Symposium on Medical Robotics (ISMR) 2025. The workshop will feature presentations and hands-on sessions focusing on open-source platforms for medical robotics development, including integration of AI, robots, and imaging devices. Join us to learn about the interoperability between 3D Slicer, ROS2, AMBF, Gazebo, and the da Vinci Research Kit.
