Needle guidance for precision needle placement in the prostate.


We are developing a 



We are focused on medical imaging and interventions. Our contributions primarily focus on developing innovative techniques and technologies to improve the accuracy and safety of needle-based procedures.

One of our notable achievements is the development of image-guided robotic systems for needle interventions. We have worked on designing and implementing robotic platforms that can precisely guide needles to the target location within the human body. These systems incorporate advanced imaging modalities, such as MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) or CT (Computed Tomography), to provide real-time feedback and enable accurate needle placement.

We have also made significant contributions to the field of prostate interventions. We have devised techniques to enhance the accuracy of prostate needle biopsies, which are commonly performed to diagnose prostate cancer. By leveraging advanced imaging and robotic technologies, Tokuda has developed methods to improve the targeting and sampling during these procedures, increasing diagnostic yield and reducing complications.
