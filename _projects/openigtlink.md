The OpenIGTLink protocol is a standardized communication protocol designed for real-time data exchange in the field of image-guided therapy (IGT). 

It provides a framework for transmitting and synchronizing data between different devices and software components involved in surgical and interventional procedures. OpenIGTLink was developed by the National Center for Image-Guided Therapy (NCIGT) and is an open-source protocol that promotes interoperability among various IGT systems. It is widely used and supported by many software applications, medical devices, and research institutions.

Key features and characteristics of the OpenIGTLink protocol include:

- Real-Time Communication: OpenIGTLink enables the transmission of data in real time, allowing for immediate exchange and synchronization of information between different components of an IGT system. This is crucial for applications that require fast and continuous updates, such as surgical navigation systems.
- Message-Based Architecture: The protocol follows a message-based architecture, where data is exchanged in discrete messages. Each message contains information about a specific data type, such as images, tracking data, or surgical tool positions. The messages are structured and standardized, ensuring consistency and compatibility across different systems.
- Lightweight and Efficient: OpenIGTLink is designed to be lightweight and efficient, minimizing the network overhead and data latency. The protocol utilizes a compact binary format for message transmission, optimizing the data transfer process and reducing bandwidth requirements.
- Bi-Directional Communication: OpenIGTLink supports bi-directional communication, allowing both the transmission and reception of data. This enables seamless interaction between different components of an IGT system, such as surgical devices, imaging systems, and visualization software.
- Data Types and Transformations: The protocol defines various data types that can be transmitted, including images, transforms, tracking data, and events. It also supports coordinate system transformations, allowing for accurate spatial registration of data across different devices or software components.
- Open and Extensible: OpenIGTLink is an open-source protocol, which means it is freely available and can be extended or customized to suit specific application requirements. The open nature of the protocol encourages collaboration, innovation, and the development of compatible software and hardware solutions.

OpenIGTLink has been widely adopted in the research and clinical communities and has become a de facto standard for real-time communication in image-guided therapy. It enables seamless integration of various IGT components, facilitates data exchange, and promotes interoperability, ultimately enhancing the capabilities and effectiveness of surgical and interventional procedures. Examples of applications that utilize OpenIGTLink include:

- Stereotactic surgical guidance using optical position sensor and medical image visualization software
- Intraoperative image guidance using real-time MRI and medical image visualization software
- Robot-assisted interventions using robotic devices and surgical planning software
