OpenIGTLink is an open-source network communication interface specifically designed for image-guided interventions. It aims to provide a plug-and-play unified real-time communications (URTC) in operating rooms (ORs) for image-guided interventions, where imagers, sensors, surgical robots,and computers from different vendors work cooperatively. This URTC will ensure the seamless data flow among those components and enable a closed-loop process of planning, control, delivery, and feedback. Examples applications of URTC include but not limited to:

- Stereotactic surgical guidance using optical position sensor and medical image visualization software
- Intraoperative image guidance using real-time MRI and medical image visualization software
- Robot-assisted interventions using robotic devices and surgical planning software
