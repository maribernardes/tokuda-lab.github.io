Software to assist prostate internvetions (e.g., biopsy, ablation, surgery) using machine learning techniques.


Our group has been working closely with clinical experts in prostate MRI and MRI-guided interventions. We have been developing software to assist prostate interventions (e.g., biopsy, ablation, surgery) using machine learning techniques. 

# Automatic Segmentation of Prostate and Neurovascular Bundles on MRI

The paper presents a method for segmenting critical structures for prostate cancer therapy, such as the prostate, neurovascular bundles (NVBs), and external urethral sphincters (EUSs), from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. The method is based on a deep learning approach that uses a domain adaptation technique to improve the performance of the segmentation model on data from a different clinical site.

The domain adaptation technique used in the method is called transfer learning. Transfer learning is a technique that allows a model trained on one dataset to be applied to another dataset. This is done by transferring the knowledge learned from the first dataset to the second dataset.

In the paper, the authors use transfer learning to improve the performance of a deep learning model for prostate segmentation. The deep learning model is first trained on a dataset of MRI images from one clinical site. The model is then fine-tuned on a dataset of MRI images from another clinical site. The fine-tuning is done using transfer learning.

The authors evaluated the performance of the proposed method on a dataset of MRI images from two clinical sites. The results showed that the proposed method was able to improve the segmentation accuracy of the deep learning model on the data from the second clinical site.

The proposed method is a promising new approach for segmenting critical structures for prostate cancer therapy. The method is able to improve the performance of deep learning models on data from different clinical sites. This is important because it allows clinicians to use deep learning models to improve the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer.

Here are some of the key findings of the paper:

Domain adaptation can be used to improve the performance of deep learning models for prostate segmentation.
Transfer learning is a effective domain adaptation technique for prostate segmentation.
The proposed method is able to improve the segmentation accuracy of deep learning models on data from different clinical sites.
The proposed method is a valuable contribution to the field of prostate cancer research. The method has the potential to improve the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer, which could lead to better outcomes for patients.
