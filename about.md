Our laboratory is located on the main campus of Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital having access to a wide variety of state-of-the-art clinical facilities, including the Advanced Multimodality Image Guided Operation (AMIGO) suite, a 5,700-square-foot operating room equipped with 3-Tesla MRI and PET/CT scanners. The proximity to those facilities allows us to work closely with clinical staff in the clinical environment to test new software and devices and obtain feedback frequently. Our projects are primarily funded by the National Institutes of Health, including:

- R01EB020667: "OpenIGTLink: a network communication interface for closed-loop image-guided interventions" (MPI: Tokuda, Krieger, Fuge, Leonard)
- R01CA235134: "Adaptive Percutaneous Prostate Interventions using Sensorized Needle" (MPI: Tokuda, Hata, Iordachita)
- R43EB032676: "Smart Multi-grid Template for Focal Therapy of Prostate Cancer" (PI: Jesung Park (PSI))
- R44CA224853: "Smart template for prostate biopsy guidance" (PI: Jesung Park (PSI))
- P41EB028741: "Advanced Technologies - National Center for Image Guided Therapy (AT-NCIGT)" (PI: Clare Tempany)
- R01EB030539: "Physician Assistance Technology in Image-guided Robotic Intervention of Prostate" (PI: Hata, Fischer)
