The Tokuda Lab. is a biomedical engineering research laboratory specialized in the development and clinical evaluation of imaging and robotics technologies to support clinical interventions. Particularly, we are focused on image-guided “closed-loop” interventions, where images are used for planning a procedure, guiding tools, and monitoring and confirming treatment effects to provide safe and effective diagnosis and treatment. Examples of our research projects include:

- Software platforms for image-guided and robot-assisted interventions
- MRI-compatible manipulators for needle placement
- Novel intraprocedural MR imaging techniques to monitor ablations

Our laboratory is located on the main campus of Brigham and Women’s Hospital having access to a wide variety of state-of-the-art clinical facilities, including the Advanced Multimodality Image Guided Operation (AMIGO) suite, a 5,700-square-foot operating room equipped with 3-Tesla MRI and PET/CT scanners. The proximity to those facilities allows us to work closely with clinical staff in the clinical environment to test new software and devices and obtain feedback frequently.

We are part of the National Center for Image-Guided Therapy, and work closely with a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and scientists. We also work with external collaborators from academic institutions and industry to pursue our research projects. Most of our research projects are funded by the National Institutes of Health and industrial partners.
