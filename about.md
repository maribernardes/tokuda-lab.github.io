# About the Lab
Our laboratory is located on the main campus of Brigham and Women’s Hospital having access to a wide variety of state-of-the-art clinical facilities, including the Advanced Multimodality Image Guided Operation (AMIGO) suite, a 5,700-square-foot operating room equipped with 3-Tesla MRI and PET/CT scanners. The proximity to those facilities allows us to work closely with clinical staff in the clinical environment to test new software and devices and obtain feedback frequently. 

# Getting Involved

There are several ways to get involved in [the research activities](/projects/). If you are seeking a paid position, please check out [the News page](/news/) for the latest job postings.

## Collaborations

We welcome collaborations with academic and industrial partners. We have a long history of successful collaborations with academic and industrial partners in developing and clinically translating software and hardware for image-guided and robot-assisted interventions. Our laboratory is specialized in adapting new computational and robotic technologies to clinical applications, and testing in the clinical environment under an IRB-approved protocol. [The National Center for Image Guided Therapy](https://ncigt.org) offers a unique translational research environment for translational research. Examples of our collaborations include:

- Pre-clinical and clinical evaluation of a robotic system for MRI-guided breast biopsy.
- Development of a robotic system for prostate interventions.
- Integration of a real-time MRI-guided intervention with a needle guidance system.
- Clinical evaluation of automatic image registration system for image-guided liver tumor ablation.

## Training/Visiting (Self-funded)

We offer training and visiting opportunities for students and researchers who are interested in image-guided and robot-assisted interventions. We have a unique translational research environment where a multidisciplinary team of clinicians, imaging physicists, computer scientists, technologists, and nurses collaborate in a state-of-the-art facility. Our laboratory is located on the main hospital campus and has easy access to the clinical environment, where we evaluate our software and/or devices regularly.

[The Office for Global Professionals and Scholars (GPS)](https://pips.partners.org) at Mass General Brigham provides visa support for international students and researchers. Please contact GPS for more information.

## Fellowship/Research Assistant

Fellowship and research assistant positions are excellent opportunities for those already pursuing or starting a biomedical engineering career. We seek an individual who is passionate about medical imaging and/or robotics for image-guided therapy. The successful candidate will be responsible for developing devices and software for image-guided robot-assisted interventions (e.g., biopsy and ablation) and testing them. [The Department of Radiology](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/radiology) and [the National Center for Image Guided Therapy](https://ncigt.org/) offer a unique translational research environment where a multidisciplinary team of clinicians, imaging physicists, computer scientists, technologists, and nurses collaborate in a state-of-the-art facility. Our laboratory is located on the main hospital campus and has easy access to the clinical environment, where we evaluate our software and/or devices regularly.

Please note that availability of paid positions depends on our funding situation. Our institution may offer visa support depending on the job title and the candidate's qualifications.
