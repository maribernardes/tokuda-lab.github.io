Our laboratory is located on the main campus of Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital having access to a wide variety of state-of-the-art clinical facilities, including the Advanced Multimodality Image Guided Operation (AMIGO) suite, a 5,700-square-foot operating room equipped with 3-Tesla MRI and PET/CT scanners. The proximity to those facilities allows us to work closely with clinical staff in the clinical environment to test new software and devices and obtain feedback frequently.

We are part of the National Center for Image-Guided Therapy, and work closely with a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and scientists. We also work with external collaborators from academic institutions and industry to pursue our research projects. Most of our research projects are funded by the National Institutes of Health and industrial partners.
