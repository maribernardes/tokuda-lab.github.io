If you are interested in collaborating with us or internship in our group, please feel free to contact us. There are several ways to get involved.

## Collaborations

We welcome collaborations with academic and industrial partners. We have a long history of successful collaborations with academic and industrial partners in developing and clinically translating software and hardware for image-guided and robot-assisted interventions. Our laboratory is specialized in adapting new computational and robotic technologies to clinical applications, and testing in the clinical environment under an IRB-approved protocol. [The National Center for Image Guided Therapy](https://ncigt.org) offers a unique translational research environment for translational research. Examples of our collaborations include:

- Pre-clinical and clinical evaluation of a robotic system for MRI-guided breast biopsy.
- Development of a robotic system for prostate interventions.
- Integration of a real-time MRI-guided intervention with a needle guidance system.
- Clinical evaluation of automatic image registration system for image-guided liver tumor ablation.

## Training/Visiting (Self-funded)

We offer training and visiting opportunities for students and researchers who are interested in image-guided and robot-assisted interventions. We have a unique translational research environment where a multidisciplinary team of clinicians, imaging physicists, computer scientists, technologists, and nurses collaborate in a state-of-the-art facility. Our laboratory is located on the main hospital campus and has easy access to the clinical environment, where we evaluate our software and/or devices regularly.

[The Office for Global Professionals and Scholars (GPS)](https://pips.partners.org) at Mass General Brigham provides visa support for international students and researchers. Please contact GPS for more information.

## Fellowship/Research Assistant

Fellowship and research assistant positions are excellent opportunities for those already pursuing or starting a biomedical engineering career. We seek an individual who is passionate about medical imaging and/or robotics for image-guided therapy. The successful candidate will be responsible for developing devices and software for image-guided robot-assisted interventions (e.g., biopsy and ablation) and testing them. [The Department of Radiology](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/radiology) and [the National Center for Image Guided Therapy](https://ncigt.org/) offer a unique translational research environment where a multidisciplinary team of clinicians, imaging physicists, computer scientists, technologists, and nurses collaborate in a state-of-the-art facility. Our laboratory is located on the main hospital campus and has easy access to the clinical environment, where we evaluate our software and/or devices regularly.

Please note that availability of paid positions depends on our funding situation. Our institution may offer visa support depending on the job title and the candidate's qualifications. For more information about visa support, please contact [The Office for Global Professionals and Scholars (GPS)](https://pips.partners.org).
