# Projects

The Tokuda Lab. is a biomedical engineering research laboratory specialized in the development and clinical evaluation of imaging and robotics technologies to support clinical interventions. We are focused on image-guided “closed-loop” interventions, where images are used for planning a procedure, guiding tools, and monitoring and confirming treatment effects to provide safe and effective diagnosis and treatment.
